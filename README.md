# Multiplayer Tick-Tac-Toe

Unfortunately, I'm submitting the assignment not as good as I wanted it to be,
since I had to struggle with a lot of unexpected difficulties on the way.

### Things that I would like to accomplish, if I had additional time (sorted by priority)

- The game isn't thread-safe and checks of the boards are done without locking
- Fix a bug that happens when moving between rooms
- Break down the app into modular classes
- Add unit tests
